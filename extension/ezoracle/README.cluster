eZ Publish 4.1 and 4.2 cluster mode is not supported with the current release of the eZ Oracle extension.

It will be be available again in the next version of the extension.

Current users of eZ Publish that run on Oracle+eZ cluster configuration are advised to
either postpone the upgrade to eZ Publish 4.1 / 4.2 or move to a non-clustered configuration.
