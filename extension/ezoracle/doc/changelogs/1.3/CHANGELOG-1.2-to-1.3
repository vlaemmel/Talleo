Changes from 1.2 to 1.3

*General:

- Added: Description of the temporary tables naming problem
  to "Oracle Notes" document.
- Added: Method eZOracleDB::generateUniqueTempTableName()
  that generates a temporary table name that is unique across all Oracle
  sessions. This method is used in eZ Publish as workaround for the
  above problem.
- Added: Auxiliary script to transfer schema & data from MySQL to Oracle.
  The script uses ezdbschema interface available in eZ Publish 3.5+.
- Renamed script drop-schema-sqlplus.sh to ora-drop-schema.sh.

*Bugfixes:
- Fixed: PHP 4.4.0 warning about misuse of references
  in eZOracleDB::arrayQuery().
- Fixed: Command line arguments processing in ora-grant.php.
