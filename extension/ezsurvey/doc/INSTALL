# to a high value
#
VersionHistoryClass[survey]=1000
VersionHistoryClass[myothersurveyclass]=1000





Getting eZ Publish
==================

You can download a version of eZ Publish from ez.no, you will find the
various versions at:
http://ez.no/ez_publish/download/all_releases/ez_publish_3_stable_releases

NOTE: You will require eZ Publish 4.0 or higher

Information on the installation of eZ Publish can be found at:
http://ez.no/ez_publish/documentation/installation


Installing eZ Survey extension
==============================

1. Copy the package into the `extension' directory in the root of your
   eZ Publish installation.

2. Unpack the files in the distribution. The command necessary is depends on
   the file you downloaded.
   [tar.gz]:
   $ tar -zxvf ezsurvey-extension-2.1.tar.gz
   [zip]:
   $ unzip ezsurvey-extension-2.1.zip

3. We must now enable the extension in eZ Publish. To do this edit
   site.ini.append(.php) in the folder root_of_ezpublish/settings/override. If this
   file does not exist; create it. Locate (or add) the block
   [ExtensionSettings] and add the line:

   ActiveExtensions[]=ezsurvey

   If you run several sites using only one distribution and only some of the
   sites should use the extension, make the changes in the override file of
   that siteaccess.
   E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/news/site.ini.append(.php)
   But instead of using ActiveExtensions you must add these lines instead:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=ezsurvey

4. Run the php script from commandline:

   $ php bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php --extension

   Which is need to build an array of classes that are used by the autoload system
   in PHP to load classes. You will need eZ Components availlable to run this script.


Configuring eZ Survey with the wizard
=====================================

If you don't want to use the eZ Survey wizard to configure and set up eZ
Survey, you may skip to Manual installation.

The following steps are included in the survey wizard.

1. Import database
   ---------------

   This page will create the necessary tables which eZ Survey are using to
   store the content.


2. Import survey content classes
   -----------------------------

   Will install the included packages which are included with eZ Survey and
   contains two content classes.

     o  Survey attribute class

       Is the content class which will be used as related objects when you
       create a new survey contentobject. The class need to contain one
       xml block attribute and one Text field attribute. The "XML block"
       attribute will be used in views for web pages and the "Text block" will
       be used as the text sent in Emails from the survey.

     o  Survey class

       Will be used as the new survey object which you can use to make a new
       survey in the content structure. The class could preferred contain a
       Text entry attribute and a survey attribute. Set the "Object name
       pattern" to the identifier of the Text entry.

   You may also do this manually by adding the two classes directly in the
   administration interface. You may always get back to the Survey Wizard, by
   follow the Survey link in the top menu of the administration interface. The
   Survey wizard will automatically detect if the necessary classes are
   installed and skip to the next step if this is done.


3. Configure the survey class attribute
   ------------------------------------

   When the survey attribute which is used to show xml formatted text between
   questions are installed it need to be configured to eZ Survey.

     o  Survey attribute class

       Need to be set to a content class which contains text attribute and
       a xml text attribute.

     o  The Browse button

       Select the parent class where new survey attributes should be stored.
       This should only be a collector for content of the survey attributes and
       should not be shown in the main structure of the site. Examples could be
       to create a folder below the media library (admin.example.com/Media) or
       a folder below setup (admin.example.com/content/view/full/48) in a
       default installation. You should remember to check the permissions, like
       the section of the new folder, which could be set to the standard
       section, to be readable by the anonymous user.

       You may create a folder in the content structure and get back to the
       survey wizard by enter the Survey link in the top menu in the admin
       interface.

       Press the Store button when you've selected a parent folder for eZ
       Survey.


4. Complete
   --------

   The eZ Survey wizard are now finised and you can enter the content structure
   and create new content of the survey class.

Manual installation
===================

Initializing database
---------------------

1. Manual install
   --------------

   o  Initialize schema

     The schema must now be created with all the tables, sequences and
     triggers for eZ Publish. Then the schema must be filled with data.
     Here you have two choices:

     You can start by insert the schema for the extension and then filling it
     with the basic data. You may skip the first to steps, if you already have
     a working eZ Publish installation working.

     o  Create the schema for eZ Publish
        $ ./bin/php/ezsqlinsertschema.php --type=<dbtype> --user=<user> \
            --password=<password> --host=<hostname> \
            share/db_schema.dba <dbname>

     o  Insert data for eZ Publish
        $ ./bin/php/ezsqlinsertschema.php --type=<dbtype> --user=<user> \
            --password=<password> --host=<hostname> \
            --schema-file=share/db_schema.dba \
            --insert-types=data \
            share/db_data.dba <dbname>

     o  Create the schema for eZ Survey. The SQL schema for the
        extension is located in ezsurvey/sql/<database-implimentation>/schema.sql
        and can be done with for example:

        mysql -u<username> -p <dbname> <  ezsurvey/sql/mysql/schema.sql

Configuration
-------------

   o  Configuring eZ Survey

     To be able to use eZ Survey, you need to add new content classes in the
     administration interface. The neccessary classes is one for the survey and
     another class for the survey attribute. Follow the links to:

     And create the new classes.

     eZ Survey need one content class to define how the "Related object"
     question attribute in the survey should be. This is a normal
     contentobject which will be created when you are in the edit view of the
     survey class. You'll get back to the survey edit view when you've
     published the new survey attribute object. The other object is the the
     content class of the survey itself. You need to add a survey attribute
     datatype to this content class.

     You may choose to add the content classes with the "Manual installation"
     or select the included package with "Add content classes from a package".

     Manual installation
     -------------------

     Setup -> Classes -> Content


     o  Survey attribute class

       Is the content class which will be used as related objects when you
       create a new survey contentobject. The class need to contain one
       xml block attribute and one Text field attribute. The "XML block"
       attribute will be used in views for web pages and the "Text block" will
       be used as the text sent in Emails from the survey.

     o  Survey class

       Will be used as the new survey object which you can use to make a new
       survey in the content structure. The class could preferred contain a
       Text entry attribute and a survey attribute. Set the "Object name
       pattern" to the identifier of the Text entry.


    Add contentclasses from a package
    ---------------------------------

     You may add the two content classes from the included package. This can be
     done in the administration interface from the url:

     Setup -> Packages -> Import new package

     After importing the package, you will have the two classes as described in
     the "Manual installation" installed.


    Configuration of the "Related object" survey attribute
    ------------------------------------------------------

     o  Add a new content folder for the Survey attribute objects.

       When a new "related object" attribute is created in a survey object, the
       related object need to be stored in a parent folder by the survey
       datatype. Create a new object (of class folder) where the related survey
       object should be stored.

     o  Configuration of the survey module

       Follow the links in the upper tab to:

       Survey -> Related object configuration

       The "Content class" should be set to the contentclass created above:
       "Survey attribute class".

       Set the parent folder for the survey attributes to be the same as
       described in the prevoius point.


     o  Create a new survey

       Create a new object, for example in "Content structure". Select Survey
       and select the language and create the survey.
